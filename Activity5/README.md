## 💻 Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses:
- **Vite** for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router** for navigation
- Custom hooks for state management

### Backend Development

The backend uses:
- **NestJS** modular architecture
- **TypeORM** for database operations
- **SQLite** for development database
- **Swagger** for API documentation
- **JWT** for authentication

### Environment Configuration

**Backend:**
- Port: `3005`
- Database: SQLite (`blog.db`)
- JWT Secret: Configured in auth module
- File uploads: `uploads/` directory

**Frontend:**
- Port: `5184`
- API Base URL: `http://localhost:3005`
- Token storage: `localStorage` (key: `a5_token`)

### Code Structure

- **Components**: React functional components with hooks
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for reusable logic
- **API Client**: Centralized API functions in `api.ts`
- **Entities**: TypeORM entities for database models
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for validation
- **Guards**: Authentication guards for protected routes

## 📝 Notes

- The SQLite database (`blog.db`) is created automatically on first run
- File uploads are stored in `backend/blog-api/uploads/`
- JWT tokens are stored in browser localStorage
- The application uses CORS for cross-origin requests
- All API endpoints include validation via class-validator

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
- Ensure port 3005 is not in use
- Check that SQLite database file is writable
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### Frontend Issues
- Ensure port 5184 is not in use
- Check that the backend server is running
- Verify API base URL matches backend port
- Clear browser localStorage if authentication issues occur

### Database Issues
- Delete `blog.db` to reset the database
- Ensure TypeORM synchronize is enabled for development
